# DataDiveX

DataDiveX lays the groundwork with initial implementations such as:

- **ANN Example**: Explore our Artificial Neural Network implementation for a simple case study.
- **ANN Regression**: Predict house prices using regression models, demonstrated on Kaggle datasets.

### Future Enhancements

In the pipeline:
- **CNN, RNN, NLP, GANs**: Future updates will include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

### How to Use DataDiveX

To get started:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DataDiveX.git
   ```

2. Explore the provided examples and pipelines to accelerate your own data analysis projects.
